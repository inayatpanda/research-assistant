# STARD 2015 reporting checklist (30 items)

## Scope

STARD applies to any study that estimates the diagnostic accuracy of one or more index tests against a reference standard. Examples: a new biomarker against histology, a point-of-care test against PCR, a clinical decision rule against gold-standard imaging.

## Key items the user must report

### Title or abstract
- [ ] 1. Identification as a study of diagnostic accuracy using at least one measure of accuracy (such as sensitivity, specificity, predictive values, or AUC).

### Abstract
- [ ] 2. Structured summary of study design, methods, results, and conclusions (for specific guidance, see STARD for Abstracts).

### Introduction
- [ ] 3. Scientific and clinical background, including the intended use and clinical role of the index test.
- [ ] 4. Study objectives and hypotheses.

### Methods — study design
- [ ] 5. Whether data collection was planned before the index test and reference standard were performed (prospective study) or after (retrospective study).

### Methods — participants
- [ ] 6. Eligibility criteria.
- [ ] 7. On what basis potentially eligible participants were identified (such as symptoms, results from previous tests, inclusion in registry).
- [ ] 8. Where and when potentially eligible participants were identified (setting, location, and dates).
- [ ] 9. Whether participants formed a consecutive, random, or convenience series.

### Methods — test methods
- [ ] 10a. Index test, in sufficient detail to allow replication.
- [ ] 10b. Reference standard, in sufficient detail to allow replication.
- [ ] 11. Rationale for choosing the reference standard (if alternatives exist).
- [ ] 12a. Definition of and rationale for test positivity cut-offs or result categories of the index test, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory.
- [ ] 12b. Definition of and rationale for test positivity cut-offs or result categories of the reference standard, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory.
- [ ] 13a. Whether clinical information and reference standard results were available to the performers/readers of the index test.
- [ ] 13b. Whether clinical information and index test results were available to the assessors of the reference standard.

### Methods — analysis
- [ ] 14. Methods for estimating or comparing measures of diagnostic accuracy.
- [ ] 15. How indeterminate index test or reference standard results were handled.
- [ ] 16. How missing data on the index test and reference standard were handled.
- [ ] 17. Any analyses of variability in diagnostic accuracy, distinguishing pre-specified from exploratory.
- [ ] 18. Intended sample size and how it was determined.

### Results — participants
- [ ] 19. Flow of participants, using a diagram.
- [ ] 20. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of participants.
- [ ] 21a. Distribution of severity of disease in those with the target condition.
- [ ] 21b. Distribution of alternative diagnoses in those without the target condition.
- [ ] 22. Time interval and any clinical interventions between index test and reference standard.

### Results — test results
- [ ] 23. Cross tabulation of the index test results (or their distribution) by the results of the reference standard.
- [ ] 24. Estimates of diagnostic accuracy and their precision (such as 95% confidence intervals).
- [ ] 25. Any adverse events from performing the index test or the reference standard.

### Discussion
- [ ] 26. Study limitations, including sources of potential bias, statistical uncertainty, and generalisability.
- [ ] 27. Implications for practice, including the intended use and clinical role of the index test.

### Other information
- [ ] 28. Registration number and name of registry.
- [ ] 29. Where the full study protocol can be accessed.
- [ ] 30. Sources of funding and other support; role of funders.

## Common mistakes

- Cross-tabulation of results omitted (item 23) — without it readers cannot recompute accuracy estimates.
- Blinding of readers not stated (item 13) — leads to ascertainment bias.
- Reporting only sensitivity/specificity at a single threshold without CIs.

## How this maps to manuscript sections in our app

- Statistics -> Diagnostic accuracy table (2x2) covers item 23.
- Statistics -> ROC curve / sensitivity-specificity output covers item 24.
- Frontmatter -> Registration field covers item 28.
