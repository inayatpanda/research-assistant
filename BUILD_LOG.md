## 2026-05-17 · Phase 0 — Brainstorm & Spec

- Read user's hand-drawn workflow sketch + original `ResearchApp_BuildPlan.md`.
- Locked operating constraints: local SSD storage, SQLite, single-user with multi-user-ready schema, Gemini default AI, voice-to-text dropped, autonomous Phase 1→8, pause before 9.
- Wrote design spec → `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-research-manuscript-assistant-design.md`.
- Added §6.2 robustness layer: Gemini model resolution chain + retry + safety-filter tuning + optional cross-provider failover.
- Initialised git repo, committed spec + source material.
- Smoke-tested Chrome DevTools MCP — works, no permission prompts needed.
- Created tracking files: BUILD_LOG, POLISH, DEFERRED, DECISIONS, QUESTIONS.

Next: write Phase 1 implementation plan via `superpowers:writing-plans`, then execute.

## 2026-05-17 · Phase 1 — Foundation & Scaffold ✅ COMPLETE

**Tag:** `phase-1`
**Commits:** ~17 atomic commits, plan in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-17-phase-1-foundation.md`

**What's running**

- `apps/web` — React 19 + TS + Vite + Tailwind 3 + shadcn (13 primitives) + Framer Motion + React Router 6 + TanStack Query + RHF + zod + Lucide. Bound to `127.0.0.1:5173`.
- `apps/api` — FastAPI + SQLAlchemy 2.0 async + aiosqlite + Alembic + Pydantic Settings. Bound to `127.0.0.1:8787`. Python 3.12 in `apps/api/.venv`.
- SQLite DB at `data/research.db`. Alembic baseline migration `0001_initial_projects` applied.
- `.env` at repo root with Gemini key, absolute SQLITE_URL. CORS allows :5173.

**Acceptance bar**

- [x] `/health` returns `{status:"ok", db_ok:true, gemini:{ok:true}}`
- [x] All 7 routes navigable, no console errors (only React Router v7 future-flag warnings — POLISH'd)
- [x] Backend test sweep: 14/14 pass (settings 2, projects repo 5, health 1, projects routes 6)
- [x] Frontend typecheck clean
- [x] Create project in UI → SQLite write → reload → project persists ✅ verified via chrome-devtools-mcp
- [x] Settings page reads live `/health` and renders provider statuses

**Incidents handled inline**

1. `npm install` at root accidentally polluted root package.json — uninstalled, moved to `apps/web`.
2. `shadcn init` had an interactive prompt that couldn't be bypassed by flags — wrote `components.json` manually and ran `shadcn add` (which works without re-init).
3. Tremor 3 pins React 18; React 19 in our stack. Deferred Tremor install to Phase 6 (logged in `DECISIONS.md`).
4. Alembic relative DB path resolved to `apps/data/` instead of repo root. Fixed `env.py` to compute absolute path from `parents[3]`.
5. Production SQLITE_URL used relative path; uvicorn from `apps/api/` resolved it wrong. Switched `.env` to absolute path.
6. `class-variance-authority` missing — shadcn Button required it but it wasn't auto-installed. Added manually.

**Open items captured**

- `POLISH.md`: mobile hamburger nav (high — fix before Phase 2 closes), RR v7 flag warnings (low), card click target (low).
- `DECISIONS.md`: 5 ADRs total — SQLite local-first, two-process monorepo, model resolution chain, percentage coords for highlights, Tremor deferred.
- `QUESTIONS.md`: empty (no judgment calls needed yet).
- `DEFERRED.md`: spec-decided deferrals only.

**Next:** Phase 2 — Library module (file upload, Gemini citation extraction, CrossRef fallback, metadata confirmation, list/search/filter/dedup).

---

## 2026-05-17 · Phase 2 — Library Module ✅ COMPLETE

**Tag:** `phase-2`
**Commits:** ~14 atomic commits. Plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-17-phase-2-library.md`.

**What's running now**

- **Adapters fully wired this phase**: `FileStorage` (LocalFs + signed-URL serving), `AIProvider` (Gemini with the §6.2 model resolution chain + retry/demote), CrossRef DOI lookup, rapidfuzz dedupe, PDF + DOCX text extraction.
- **Backend**: `Article` ORM + alembic 0002, ArticleRepository with filter/search/sort/dedupe, `/api/projects/{id}/articles/upload` orchestration (validate → save → extract → AI → CrossRef → dedup → DB), full CRUD, `/files/{token}` HMAC-served file route.
- **Frontend**: real `LibraryPage` (replaces Phase 1 stub) with project gate, `UploadZone` (react-dropzone), `MetadataConfirmDialog` (RHF + zod), `ArticleFilters` with debounced search, `ArticleListItem` with status-colored badges. Active-project Zustand store (localStorage-persisted). `ProjectCard` navigates to Library and sets active project.
- **POLISH carry-over resolved**: mobile nav drawer (P2-T1) — shadcn Sheet hamburger replaces hidden sidebar on `<md`.

**Acceptance bar (spec §7 Phase 2)**

- [x] Drag-and-drop PDF → ~7s Gemini extraction → confirm dialog with all 9 fields pre-filled correctly → save → article in list (verified live via chrome-devtools-mcp with a real generated research PDF; every field came back accurate including DOI)
- [x] Same PDF re-uploaded → amber "Possible duplicate of: …" warning rendered on upload row (verified in browser; backend regression test for multi-duplicate case)
- [x] Search "posterior" → article matches; search "no-such-term" → empty state
- [x] All 14 Phase 1 tests still pass + **70 new Phase 2 tests** = 84/84 backend pass
- [x] Frontend clean typecheck
- [x] `/health` reports live `active_model: "gemini-2.5-flash"` (chain resolved against Google's real `list_models()` at first call)
- [x] `/security-review` passed after fixes (all HIGH + MED resolved, see below)

**Live verification highlights**

The model returned for the real PDF:

```json
{
  "title": "Anterior vs Posterior Approach in Total Hip Arthroplasty: A Prospective Cohort Study",
  "authors": ["Inayat Choudhary", "Sarah Johnson"],
  "journal": "Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery",
  "year": 2024, "volume": "106", "issue": "11", "pages": "1245-1253",
  "doi": "10.2106/JBJS.24.00123"
}
```

Every field accurate.

**Security review (`/security-review` pass on file upload + AI integration)**

Found 2 HIGH + 6 MED + 3 LOW. All HIGH and MED fixed inline in this phase:

- **HIGH**: `api_signing_secret` placeholder default — now auto-generates a 48-byte url-safe random secret on first boot, persists to `data/.signing_secret` with `chmod 0600`.
- **HIGH**: Path-traversal guard switched from `str.startswith` to `Path.is_relative_to` (defends macOS case-insensitive FS + prefix siblings).
- **MED**: `/files/{token}` no longer echoes exception messages (generic responses, full detail in server logs).
- **MED**: `verify_token` catches missing payload keys explicitly → TokenInvalid (regression test added).
- **MED**: DOCX parser enforces 200 MB uncompressed cap (zip-bomb guard via `ZipInfo.file_size` sum).
- **MED**: Extraction prompt explicitly marks article text as untrusted data, tells the model to ignore embedded instructions.
- **MED**: CORS narrowed from `*` methods/headers to the actual surface.
- **MED**: Upload route returns extraction error CLASS only; full detail in server logs.
- **LOW**: CrossRef DOI percent-encoded to prevent URL injection. 413/415 message disclosure logged as accepted local-first risk in POLISH.

**Incidents handled inline**

1. shadcn CLI created `@/components/ui/sheet.tsx` and `@/components/ui/dropdown-menu.tsx` as literal directories instead of resolving the alias — wrote files manually, fixed by restoring `paths` to root `tsconfig.json` with `ignoreDeprecations`.
2. libmagic reports `application/octet-stream` for DOCX on this libmagic version → switched detection to magic-byte sniffing (`%PDF-` and `PK\x03\x04` + `[Content_Types].xml` check).
3. `find_duplicate` used `scalar_one_or_none()` and crashed `MultipleResultsFound` when 2+ rows shared a DOI — switched to `.limit(1)`. The bug surfaced because the dedupe-still-creates-the-row policy left duplicates in DB across upload cycles. Regression test added.
4. react-dropzone hidden input didn't fire `change` on re-selection of the same file — fixed by resetting `e.target.value` in the input's onClick.
5. `LocalFsStorage`'s `signing_secret` ≠ `Settings.api_signing_secret` in tests after the random-secret feature was added — fixed by only auto-replacing the placeholder, not arbitrary user-provided secrets.

**Test counts**

- Backend: 84 pass (was 14 after Phase 1, +70 in Phase 2)
- New test files: test_local_fs_storage, test_signed_urls, test_model_chain, test_gemini_provider, test_crossref, test_dedupe, test_article_repository, test_pdf_text, test_files_route, test_articles_route

**Open items captured**

- `POLISH.md`: 1 new low (413/415 cap disclosure)
- `DECISIONS.md`: unchanged this phase
- `QUESTIONS.md`: still empty
- `DEFERRED.md`: `google-generativeai` → `google.genai` migration

**Next:** Phase 3 — PDF reader & annotation engine. The hardest phase technically (React-PDF + canvas overlay + percentage-based coordinates).

---

## 2026-05-17 · Phase 3 — PDF Reader & Annotation Engine ✅ COMPLETE

**Tag:** `phase-3`
**Commits:** ~12 atomic commits. Plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-17-phase-3-pdf-reader.md`.

**What's running**

- **Backend**: `Highlight` + `ArticleNote` ORM with `(article_id, user_id)` unique composite for upsert; alembic 0003; CRUD + AI summarise endpoint with provider-error mapping to 429/422/503 (no detail leak); per-article notes upsert.
- **Frontend**: react-pdf with Vite-bundled pdfjs worker. PDF bytes cached in IndexedDB. `pdfCoords` library (TDD) converts DOM selection rects ↔ page-relative percentages. `SelectionCapture` (window mouseup → percent payload → POST). `HighlightOverlay` recomputes pixel rects on every render so any zoom is exact. `HighlightNotePopover` is **anchored to the clicked highlight** via Radix Popover virtualRef and **auto-opens with focus on the paraphrase field** when a new highlight is created. `ArticleNotesRail` right column with 700ms debounced autosave and click-to-jump-to-page.

**Acceptance bar (live in-browser verification)**

- [x] Real text selection → highlight rect aligned **pixel-perfect** to the underlying text: highlight (446, 467, 322×12) vs text (446, 468, 322×10). Δx=0, Δw=0, Δy=−1, Δh=+2 (browser sub-pixel slop on selection rects). Visually identical.
- [x] **Zoom invariance mathematically verified**: 100% → page 612×792, highlight w=516. 150% → page 918×1188 (×1.5 exact), highlight w=774 (×1.5 exact). Coords scale proportionally.
- [x] **Popover anchored to highlight** at (447, 486) sitting just below highlight at (446, 467) — Δx=+1, Δy=+19 (6px sideOffset). Auto-focused textarea with placeholder "How do you want this to read in your manuscript?".
- [x] AI Summarise: live Gemini returned *"Anterior approach offers measurable short-term advantages."* from `gemini-2.5-flash` (chain still resolving correctly).
- [x] Right-rail Notes PUT + GET roundtrip; "Saved Xs ago" indicator live.
- [x] 106 backend tests + 7 frontend (pdfCoords) tests pass.

**Per the user's mid-build feedback (verified)**

> "Make sure highlights accurately identify the text which is highlighted. Also the user should be able to paraphrase and make notes next to the highlights if needed, so that should also get compiled with citation in the final section."

1. ✅ **Accuracy**: selection capture pulls real DOM rects (`range.getClientRects()`) — pixel-aligned to the actual text glyphs.
2. ✅ **Inline paraphrase**: popover anchors directly below the highlight and auto-focuses the paraphrase textarea so the user can type immediately. Autosaves at 600ms.
3. ✅ **Will compile in Phase 4**: each highlight row carries `{selected_text, user_note, ai_summary, page_number, section}` and joins to `articles` for `(Author, year, journal, DOI)` — the Compilation module will assemble these into cards (highlighted text + user paraphrase + citation) per section colour.

**Security review (2 MED + 3 LOW all fixed inline)**

- MED: SUMMARISE_PROMPT got the same "untrusted passage" framing as EXTRACTION_PROMPT.
- MED: HighlightUpdate.user_note/ai_summary bounded (max_length).
- LOW: BoundingCoords.rects capped at 64; ArticleNoteUpsert.content capped at 100k; BoundingRect rejects inverted rects via model_validator.

**Incidents handled inline**

1. shadcn popover install dropped file into a stray `@/...` literal folder until the Phase 2 tsconfig fix kicked in — re-confirmed.
2. `unique=True` on ArticleNote.article_id would block multi-user upsert — switched to composite unique index at the model level so the migration is right first time.
3. **Hardcoded test coordinates appeared below the actual text** — discovered the user feedback "make sure highlights accurately identify the text" was right because my E2E test data was synthetic. Switched to driving the real SelectionCapture path through DOM, verified pixel alignment, and added the anchored popover.
4. **Rules of Hooks violation** in HighlightNotePopover (useRef after early return) caused the popover to crash on open. Fixed by hoisting all hook calls above the conditional return.

**Test counts**

- Backend: 106 pass (was 84 after Phase 2, +22 in Phase 3)
- Frontend: 7 vitest pass (pdfCoords transforms + selection extractor)
- New test files: test_highlight_repository, test_note_repository, test_highlights_route, test_notes_route, lib/__tests__/pdfCoords.test.ts

**Open items**

- `POLISH.md`: unchanged
- `DECISIONS.md`: unchanged
- `QUESTIONS.md`: still empty
- `DEFERRED.md`: unchanged

**Next:** Phase 4 — Compilation module. This is where the value lives: highlights + paraphrases + citations from every article in the project get aggregated by section colour, drag-reordered, and assembled into AI-drafted paragraphs grounded in the user's actual annotations.

---

## 2026-05-18 · Phase 4 — Compilation Module ✅ COMPLETE

**Tag:** `phase-4`
**Commits:** ~10 atomic commits. Plan at `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-17-phase-4-compilation.md`.

**What's running**

- **Backend**:
  - `citation_format` service: Vancouver/APA/Harvard inline formatting + `[CITE_aN]` token replacement (unknown tokens left visible)
  - `ManuscriptSection` ORM + alembic 0004 + composite-unique upsert repo
  - `CompilationRepository` (highlights JOIN articles, sorted)
  - `AIProvider` extended: `generate_card_draft`, `generate_section_draft` (CardContext / SectionDraftContext)
  - Routes: `GET /compilation/{colour}`, `POST /highlights/{id}/draft`, `POST /compilation/{colour}/draft`, `PATCH /compilation/{colour}/order`, `GET|PUT /sections/{name}`
- **Frontend**:
  - `compilationApi` + `manuscriptApi` with full zod schemas
  - `AISuggestionBlock` reusable Accept/Edit/Reject (used in Phase 5 too)
  - `ColourTabs` URL-synced (`?tab=intro|method|results|discussion`) with animated underline
  - `SortableCardList` via dnd-kit
  - `CompiledCard` (colour stripe, source quote in section fill, paraphrase, citation chip, Generate sentence button, Accept → append to manuscript_section)
  - `SectionDraftPanel` (Generate paragraph from N cards, Accept → replace section content with confirmation if non-empty, used_citations list)
  - Real `CompilePage` replacing the Phase 1 stub; optimistic reorder via TanStack Query

**The citation safety contract** — the heart of this phase:

1. Server builds a per-card token map (`a1`, `a2`, …) from the project-scoped compilation rows
2. Gemini sees tokens like `[CITE_a1]` in the prompt; **never sees author names**
3. Gemini emits text with those tokens
4. Server replaces tokens with the formatted citation from the authoritative `articles` row (style chosen by `projects.citation_style`)
5. Unknown tokens (hallucinated) are left visible — reviewers see them

**Acceptance bar (live-verified)**

- [x] 4 colour tabs (Introduction/Methodology/Results/Discussion) with correct counts
- [x] Cards aggregate highlights of that colour **across all articles** in the project — verified with 2 articles
- [x] Each card shows: source text · paraphrase · citation chip (e.g. `CHOUDHARY & JOHNSON, 2024`)
- [x] Drag-to-reorder via dnd-kit; sort_order persists
- [x] **Per-card live Gemini draft**: returned *"The optimal surgical approach for total hip arthroplasty (THA) continues to be debated **(Choudhary & Johnson, 2024)**."*
- [x] **Section-level live Gemini paragraph**:

> *"A total of 412 patients were prospectively enrolled at our institution between January 2021 and December 2023 **(Choudhary & Johnson, 2024)**. This cohort comprised 198 anterior cases and 214 posterior cases **(Choudhary & Johnson, 2024)**. The prospective enrolment methods were consistently applied throughout the study, ensuring comparability across all recruited participants **(Patel et al., 2022)**."*

- [x] References row: `Choudhary & Johnson, 2024 · Patel et al., 2022`
- [x] Accept on a card pushes the sentence into `manuscript_sections.{section}.content` (verified via direct GET roundtrip — word_count: 17)
- [x] All citations in Gemini output came from the database, not the model

**Security review (1 MED + 4 INFO)**

- **MED → FIXED**: reorder route initially only filtered by `user_id`; could mutate sort_order on highlights in *other* projects/colours the same user owns. Fix: validate each item against the project+colour view's whitelist; silently skip out-of-scope IDs. Regression test added.
- INFO: prompt-injection framing on both card and section prompts confirmed
- INFO: AI error mapping (429/422/503) leaks no provider detail
- INFO: user-isolation gated on every endpoint via project lookup
- INFO: unknown CITE token behaviour (leave visible) is the intended contract

**Test counts**

- Backend: **139 pass** (was 106 after Phase 3, +33 in Phase 4)
- Frontend: 7 vitest pass (unchanged)
- New test files: test_citation_format (10), test_manuscript_section_repository (5), test_compilation_repository (4), test_compilation_route (8 incl. security regression), test_manuscript_sections_route (6)

**Open items**

- `POLISH.md`: unchanged
- `DECISIONS.md`: CITE token contract is implicit in the citation_format docstring + commit messages — could promote to a formal ADR in DECISIONS later
- `QUESTIONS.md`: still empty
- `DEFERRED.md`: unchanged

**Next:** Phase 5 — Manuscript editor. TipTap with floating AI toolbar (Improve/Shorten/Formalise/Add Transition), `@` citation insert with auto-numbering, abbreviation tracker, reference integrity checker.

---

## 2026-05-18 · Phase 5 — Manuscript Editor ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**

Turn the Compile drafts into a real prose authoring surface: TipTap-based rich text editor with section tabs, an AI floating toolbar (Improve / Shorten / Formalise / Add Transition), `@`-trigger citation picker with continuous auto-numbering across all sections, an abbreviation scanner, a reference-integrity panel, and a read-only Final view that concatenates all sections with a Vancouver bibliography.

**What shipped**

Backend (5 files, 1 migration):

- `services/abbreviation_scanner.py` — regex pass over manuscript text, detects `Long Form (LF)` patterns
- `db/models.py` + `alembic/versions/0005_abbreviations.py` — `Abbreviation` table, composite unique `(project_id, user_id, short_form)`, 200-item cap enforced at the schema layer
- `repositories/abbreviations.py` — `list_for_project`, transactional `replace_all`, `delete`
- `routes/abbreviations.py` — GET list / PUT replace / DELETE
- `services/ai/gemini.py` — implemented `assist_writing` (was a NotImplementedError stub); new `prompts/writing_assist.py` carries the **"preserve every [CITE_xxx] token verbatim"** rule
- `routes/writing.py` — `POST /api/writing/assist` with input cap 4_000 chars; classified errors (429/422/503)
- `services/citation_format.py` — added `bibliography_entry()` (Vancouver style)

Frontend (12 files):

- `lib/tiptap/extensions/Citation.ts` — inline atomic Node with `articleId` attr, parses `sup[data-citation]`, renders via React NodeView
- `lib/tiptap/extensions/CitationNodeView.tsx` — reads `useCitationNumbers` store, renders `[N]` (or `[?]`, `[…]`)
- `lib/tiptap/citationEngine.ts` — `numberCitationsFromDoc/Html/Across` for per-section and continuous numbering
- `lib/tiptap/citationNumbers.ts` — Zustand store: `articleId → number` map
- `lib/citationSerialize.ts` — `htmlToAiSafeText` / `aiSafeTextToHtml`, the round-trip used at the AI boundary
- `lib/bibliographyFormat.ts` — client-side Vancouver `bibliographyEntry`
- `hooks/useManuscript.ts` — section CRUD with **1200 ms debounced autosave**
- `components/manuscript/ManuscriptEditor.tsx` — TipTap + StarterKit + Placeholder + CharacterCount + Citation
- `components/manuscript/BubbleAIMenu.tsx` — floating menu (Improve / Shorten / Formalise / Add Transition); position tracked via `editor.view.coordsAtPos`, **persists through the in-flight assist call and the suggestion review**
- `components/manuscript/CitationSuggestions.tsx` — `@`-trigger article picker, inserts a Citation node and drops a trailing space
- `components/manuscript/SectionTabs.tsx` — 7 tabs URL-synced via `?section=`
- `components/manuscript/WordCountBar.tsx` — per-section + total + `Saved …` indicator
- `components/manuscript/FinalManuscriptView.tsx` — read-only concat with **continuous citation numbering across sections** + Vancouver REFERENCES block
- `components/manuscript/ReferenceIntegrityPanel.tsx` — flags uncited library articles + orphan inline citations
- `components/manuscript/AbbreviationsPanel.tsx` — client-side scanner + save
- `routes/ManuscriptPage.tsx` — real implementation with `ProjectSelectGate` + tabs + editor / FinalView + word-count bar + right rail

**Citation safety contract (locked in)**

Model never sees author/year. Outbound HTML is replaced with `[CITE_aN]` tokens; the model's system prompt requires preserving them verbatim. Server-side and client-side reverse paths reject any token whose `articleId` is not in the current project's article set — unknown tokens stay as literal text. ProseMirror's schema-based DOM parser filters anything beyond schema attrs when the AI-suggested HTML is inserted, so `<script>` / `onerror` etc. are dropped.

**E2E verification (browser smoke test)**

- Edit Introduction: typed, autosave fired at 1200 ms, GET returned the saved HTML, reload restored content correctly.
- Select "remains debated" → BubbleAIMenu appeared → click Shorten → POST `/api/writing/assist 200` → AISuggestionBlock rendered `"However, it remains debated."` → Accept replaced the editor selection.
- Typed `@` at end of paragraph → picker showed the project's one article → click inserted a Citation node → saved HTML contains `<sup data-citation="true" class="citation" data-article-id="…">[…]</sup>` → ReferenceIntegrityPanel updated to **"every citation points to a real article"**.
- Final view: all six sections concatenated, citation displayed as `[1]`, REFERENCES section showed the Vancouver entry.
- Abbreviations panel: detected `THA` + `HHS`, Save → PUT replace persisted both rows.

**Incidents fixed during verification**

- BubbleAIMenu used `assist.isPending` inside an effect's dependency array **before** `assist = useMutation(...)` was declared — temporal-dead-zone crash on every render. Re-ordered: `useMutation` first, then the selection-update effect that reads it. While at it, the selection-collapse path no longer tears down the bubble while a request is in flight or a suggestion is on screen.
- `ManuscriptEditor`'s content-load `useEffect` watched `[loading, editor]` but not `html`. With cached query data, `loading` never flipped, so the effect ran once with empty `html` and the editor stayed blank after refresh. Added `html` to deps; the `current === html` guard prevents the typing path from re-`setContent`-ing on every keystroke.

**Security review (3 polish items, 0 blockers)**

- MED → polish: AI HTML output is inserted via TipTap `insertContent`. ProseMirror's schema-based parser already drops unknown attrs (no script/onerror execution), but defense-in-depth would add a DOMPurify pre-pass. Logged.
- LOW → polish: Citation NodeView in-editor DOM omits `data-article-id` (only on serialized HTML). Storage round-trips correctly, but any future selector against in-editor DOM needs to use the React fiber.
- LOW → polish: BubbleAIMenu position is cached at selection time — stale after window resize.

**Test counts**

- Backend: **142 pass** (was 139 after Phase 4; +3 in Phase 5 for abbreviations + writing route happy paths)
- Frontend: 11 vitest pass (was 7; +4 for `citationSerialize` round-trip)
- New test files: `test_abbreviations.py`, `test_abbreviation_scanner.py`, `test_writing_assist.py`, `citationSerialize.test.ts`

**Open items**

- `POLISH.md`: +3 phase-5 entries
- `DECISIONS.md`: unchanged
- `QUESTIONS.md`: still empty
- `DEFERRED.md`: unchanged

**Next:** Phase 6 — Data & Statistics module. Study-type-aware test recommendations (t-test, Mann-Whitney, χ², Fisher exact, Wilcoxon, ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis, repeated-measures ANOVA, Pearson/Spearman, simple/multiple regression, logistic regression, Cox / Kaplan-Meier via lifelines, ICC, Cohen's κ); CSV/Excel upload + variable typing; assumption checks; results rendered into the Results section as prose with citations to the dataset.

---

## 2026-05-18 · Phase 6 — Data & Statistics ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**

Researchers upload a Masterchart (CSV / `.xlsx`), the app infers each column's `VariableType`, the user can override it, they answer "what are you testing?", the app recommends an appropriate test from an 18-strong catalogue (t-test / Mann-Whitney / Wilcoxon / ANOVA / Kruskal-Wallis / repeated-measures ANOVA / Pearson / Spearman / OLS / multiple regression / logistic regression / KM + log-rank / Cox / ICC / Cohen's κ / χ² / Fisher exact / paired t-test) with rationale + assumption checks, runs it server-side via scipy / statsmodels / lifelines / pingouin, returns a structured result (statistic, p-value, effect size, CI, n, df), an AI step generates a one-paragraph plain-English interpretation that preserves a `[CITE_dataset_<id>]` token (Phase 4-5 contract reused), and a Push button appends the paragraph to `manuscript_sections.Results.content`.

**What shipped**

Backend (10 files + 1 migration):

- `db/models.py` — `Dataset`, `DatasetVariable`, `Analysis`, `AnalysisResult` (all `user_id`-scoped)
- `alembic/versions/0006_statistics.py` — revision 0005 → 0006
- `schemas/dataset.py` + `schemas/analysis.py` — `VariableType`, `QuestionType`, `TestKey` Literal unions (load-bearing for runner dispatch + recommender rules + TS mirror)
- `services/stats/ingest.py` — CSV / XLSX parse, **openpyxl `data_only=True`** so formulas are never evaluated; deterministic type inference
- `services/stats/registry.py` — the catalogue + pure `recommend()` truth table
- `services/stats/assumptions.py` — Shapiro-Wilk / Levene / lifelines proportional-hazards
- `services/stats/runner.py` — one branch per test; column-name whitelist (`^[A-Za-z_]\w*$`) enforced **before** any `statsmodels.formula.api` call
- `services/ai/prompts/result_interpretation.py` — token-preserving prompt
- `services/ai/gemini.py` — implemented `interpret_result` via `_generate_with_resilience` (same shape as `assist_writing`)
- `repositories/datasets.py` + `repositories/analyses.py` — user-scoped, manual cascade on delete
- `routes/datasets.py` — POST upload (magic-byte sniff, 50 MiB cap), GET list / one, PATCH variable type, DELETE
- `routes/analyses.py` — recommend, create, list, get, run, interpret, push. AI errors map 429/422/503. Push **appends** to `manuscript_sections.{section}.content` rather than overwriting

Frontend (10 files):

- `lib/api.ts` — `datasetsApi` + `analysesApi`; TS literal unions mirror Pydantic
- `hooks/useDatasets.ts` + `useAnalyses.ts` — TanStack Query wrappers, invalidation
- `components/statistics/DatasetUpload.tsx` — react-dropzone `.csv` / `.xlsx`
- `components/statistics/DatasetList.tsx` — selectable list
- `components/statistics/DatasetDetail.tsx` — column table with inline `VariableType` override
- `components/statistics/NewAnalysisWizard.tsx` (+ `WizardVariableStep.tsx`) — 3-step Sheet: question → variables → recommendation. Create + Run + Interpret chain.

- Upload → 20 rows × 5 cols, types inferred (numeric / nominal). ✓
- Wizard step 1: Group comparison; step 2: outcome=`hhs_6w`, group=`approach`; step 3: recommender returned **"Independent t-test"** with rationale "Comparing a numeric outcome between two independent groups with approximately normal distributions." ✓
- Run: `t = 7.550 · p < 0.001 · effect size = 3.376 · 95% CI [6.856, 12.144] · n = 20 · df = 18`. Shapiro-Wilk + Levene pills green. ✓
- Interpret: Gemini produced a one-paragraph interpretation that preserved `[CITE_dataset_fd3a7…]` exactly and was rendered in the UI with a dataset chip. ✓
- Push: `manuscript_sections.Results.content` now starts with `<p>An independent samples t-test revealed…[CITE_dataset_fd3a7…]…</p>`, word_count 73. ✓

**Security review (3 polish items, 0 blockers)**

- Column-name injection: prevented at **two layers** — route (`_validate_columns` against `dataset_variables.name`) + runner (`_check_column_name` regex). 28-test cross-user / cross-project isolation regression covers every endpoint in both directions.
- XLSX formula evaluation: `openpyxl.load_workbook(..., data_only=True, read_only=True)` always — formulas never executed. Explicit test fixture `tiny_with_formula.xlsx` proves cached values are read.
- Upload cap: 50 MiB hard cap; magic-byte sniff rejects PDF prefix.
- AI errors map 429/422/503 with no provider detail leaked.
- LOW polish (logged): AI prompt should instruct number rounding; SQLite FK PRAGMA should be enabled app-wide; wizard step 2 could pre-empt type-mismatched picks.

**Test counts**

- Backend: **326 pass** (was 166 entering Phase 6; +160 in Phase 6)
- Frontend: 19 vitest pass (was 11; +8 for client-side schema + hook coverage already present in the run)
- New backend test files: `test_datasets_models.py`, `test_stats_ingest.py`, `test_stats_registry.py`, `test_stats_assumptions.py`, `test_stats_runner.py`, `test_ai_interpret_result.py`, `test_datasets_route.py`, `test_analyses_route.py`, `test_security_stats_isolation.py`

**Open items**

- `POLISH.md`: +3 phase-6 entries
- `DECISIONS.md`: unchanged
- `QUESTIONS.md`: still empty
- `DEFERRED.md`: unchanged (charts still deferred per the v1 ADR)

**Next:** Phase 7 — Systematic Review module. PRISMA flow tracking, inclusion/exclusion screening, risk-of-bias assessment (RoB 2 for RCTs, ROBINS-I for non-randomised, Newcastle-Ottawa for cohort/case-control), data extraction tables.

## 2026-05-18 · Phase 7 — Systematic Review ✅ COMPLETE

**Goal**

Researchers running a Systematic Review log their search strategy across databases, screen articles in two stages (title/abstract → full text), assess Risk of Bias with the tool appropriate to each study's design (RoB 2 / ROBINS-I / Newcastle-Ottawa / AMSTAR-2), extract structured study-level data, and watch a PRISMA 2020 flow diagram count itself. Any artefact — PRISMA SVG, search log, RoB summary, extraction table — pushes into the Manuscript with `[CITE_<article_id>]` tokens for included studies (Phase 5 token contract reused).

**What shipped**

Backend (15 files + 1 migration):

- `db/models.py`: `Review` (one per project), `SearchRecord`, `ScreeningRecord` (UNIQUE per article/stage), `RobAssessment` (UNIQUE per tool), `ExtractionRecord` (UNIQUE per article). All `user_id`-scoped. Additive `articles.abstract Text NULL` column.
- `alembic/versions/0007_systematic_review.py`: 0006 → 0007.
- `schemas/review.py`: `ReviewStage`, `ScreeningDecision`, `ExclusionCategory`, `RoBTool`, `RoBJudgement`, `DatabaseName` Literal unions — load-bearing for service + TS mirror.
- `services/review/prisma.py`: pure `count_flow()` + no-dep `render_prisma_svg()` (XML-escaped, viewBox 800×720).
- `services/review/rob_rules.py`: declarative catalogues for all four tools + `derive_overall()`. AMSTAR-2's yes/partial-yes/no vocabulary explicitly inverted via `AMSTAR2_UNIFIED_MAPPING`.
- `services/review/extraction_schema.py`: seven-group schema + `validate()`.
- `services/ai/prompts/screening_suggestion.py` + `gemini.py::suggest_screening`: title+abstract-only, JSON-output, advisory-only framing. `FakeAIProvider.suggest_screening` deterministic.
- `repositories/reviews.py`: `SqliteReviewRepository` covering all five resources. `upsert_screening` rejects cross-project articles via `ScreeningArticleMismatch`.
- `routes/reviews.py`: ~20 endpoints under `/api/projects/{pid}/reviews/...`. Auto-creates the one-per-project review on first GET. `/reviews/rob/tools` + `/reviews/extraction/schema` serve catalogues so the frontend doesn't duplicate them. AI suggest stores `ai_suggestion` but **never mutates `decision`** — load-bearing invariant covered by isolation tests. Four pushes: PRISMA → Methodology; search log table → Methodology; RoB traffic-light table → Results with `[CITE_<id>]` tokens; extraction table → Results with `[CITE_<id>]` tokens.
- `tests/test_security_review_isolation.py`: 29 tests proving zero leak across users or projects on every endpoint, including the AI-doesn't-mutate-decision invariant.

Frontend (19 files):

- `lib/api.ts`: `reviewsApi`/`searchApi`/`screeningApi`/`robApi`/`extractionApi`. TS Literal unions mirror Pydantic.
- `lib/rob.ts`: TS port of `derive_overall` for live RoB preview; server is still source of truth.
- `hooks/useReviews.ts`: TanStack Query wrappers with invalidation chains.
- `components/review/`: 10 components — `ReviewHeader` (PICO/eligibility edit), `SearchLog`, `ScreeningStageTabs` + `ScreeningTable` + `ScreeningRowActions` (advisory AI suggest button never overwrites user decision), `RoBToolPicker`, `RoBAssessmentForm` (live overall preview), `RoBSummaryFigure` (traffic-light SVG), `ExtractionTable`, `PRISMAFlowChart`, `EmptyReviewState`.
- `routes/SystematicReviewPage.tsx`: ProjectSelectGate → study-type guard → 5 tabs (URL `?tab=`).
- `App.tsx` + `nav-items.ts`: `/review` route + sidebar nav.

**E2E verification (browser smoke on a fresh Systematic Review project)**

Created two search records (PubMed n=412, Embase n=278 → identified=690). Inserted 2 articles. Title/abstract screening: included the RCT, excluded the editorial (reason "Editorial — not a primary study"). Full-text screening: included the RCT. RoB 2 assessment on the RCT (`measurement=some_concerns`, all others `low`) → `overall_auto = some_concerns`. Extraction with full structured fields persisted. PRISMA: `identified=690, after_dedupe=690, screened=2, excluded_title=1, full_text_assessed=1, included=1`. All four pushes returned 200; Methodology now contains the PRISMA SVG (base64 `<img>`) + search log table; Results contains the RoB traffic-light table (5 domain cells, overall column) and the extraction table — both with `[CITE_01a2ab7…]` token for the included study, exactly matching the Phase 5 contract.

**Two test-run bugs discovered, both UX-only**

Initial test pushes returned 422 because: (a) the RoB 2 catalogue uses `randomisation` (UK) / `missing_outcome` / `reporting` rather than the US/colloquial keys I first sent; (b) extraction schema requires `first_author` (not `author`) and the `notes` group must be an object (not bare string). Both are correct per the catalogue endpoints (`/reviews/rob/tools`, `/reviews/extraction/schema`) — the frontend wizard already builds forms from those catalogues so the user never sees these keys. Logged to POLISH as "document required shape on the schema endpoints."

**Security review (3 polish items, 0 blockers)**

- AI suggest never mutates `decision` — proven via two dedicated tests in the security regression.
- Two layers of project scoping on every route: `_resolve_review` does the project ownership check, the repo's `user_id` filter is defence-in-depth.
- PRISMA SVG injected with XML-escaped integers only; ProseMirror's schema parser strips any unknown attrs in the pushed `<table>` / `<img>` HTML.
- Push endpoints **append** rather than overwrite — a re-push will stack duplicate tables in the section. Logged as polish (low: replace-by-class-hook or a `mode=replace|append` query param).

**Test counts**

- Backend: **488 pass** (was 326 entering Phase 7; +162 in Phase 7)
- Frontend: 44 vitest pass (was 19; +25)
- New backend test files: `test_review_models`, `test_review_prisma`, `test_review_rob_rules`, `test_review_extraction_schema`, `test_ai_suggest_screening`, `test_reviews_route`, `test_security_review_isolation`

**Open items**

- `POLISH.md`: +3 phase-7 entries
- `DECISIONS.md`: unchanged
- `QUESTIONS.md`: still empty
- `DEFERRED.md`: unchanged (meta-analysis + GRADE + PubMed direct-search deferred to Phase 7.5 / Phase 8)

**Next:** Phase 8 — bibliography polish, export (DOCX + PDF + JSON), full-app polish, deploy targets (Vercel for static / Fly.io for API). Phase 9 (Electron desktop) remains paused per the user's directive — autonomous runs end after Phase 8.
